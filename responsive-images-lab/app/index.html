    <!-- TODO 3.1 - add the srcset to the SFO image below 
    srcset="images/sfo-1600_large.jpg, images/sfo-1000_large.jpg, images/sfo-800_medium.jpg, images/sfo-500_small.jpg"
      In the images/ folder there are several versions of the SFO image, each at different resolutions. We list these in the srcset attribute to give the browser the option to choose which file to use. However, the browser has no way of determining the file sizes before it loads them, so it always chooses the first image in the list.
    -->

    <!-- TODO 3.2 - add width descriptors to the SFO image below 
    srcset="images/sfo-1600_large.jpg 1600w, images/sfo-1000_large.jpg 1000w, images/sfo-800_medium.jpg 800w, images/sfo-500_small.jpg 500w"
    By adding a width descriptor to each file in the srcset, we are telling the browser the width of each image in pixels before it fetches the image. The browser can then use these widths to decide which image to fetch based on its window size. It fetches the image with the smallest width that is still larger than the viewport width.

    Note: You can also optionally specify a pixel density instead of a width. However, you cannot specify both pixel densities and widths in the same srcset attribute. We explore using pixel densities in a later section.
    -->

    <!-- TODO 4.2 - add the sizes attribute to the SFO image below 
    <img id="sfo" src="images/sfo-500_small.jpg" srcset="images/sfo-1600_large.jpg 1600w, images/sfo-1000_large.jpg 1000w, images/sfo-800_medium.jpg 800w, images/sfo-500_small.jpg 500w" sizes="50vw" alt="View from aircraft window near San Francisco airport">

    The sizes value matches the image's max-width value in the CSS. The browser now has everything it needs to choose the correct image version. The browser knows its own viewport width and the pixel density of the user's device, and we have given it the source files' dimensions (using the width descriptor) and the image sizes relative to the viewport (using the sizes attribute).
    -->

    <!-- TODO 5.2 - add the media query to the sizes attribute in the SFO image below 
    
    We can tell the browser about the media query in the sizes attribute so that it fetches the correct image when the image changes size.
  
    sizes="(max-width: 700px) 90vw, 50vw"

    <!-- TODO 6 - add the figure element containing picture and source elements 
    The picture element lets us define multiple source files using the source tag. This is different than simply using an img tag with the srcset attribute because the source tag lets us add things like media queries to each set of sources. Instead of giving the browser the image sizes and letting it decide which files to use, we can define the images to use at each window size.

    We have included several versions of the sample image, each at different resolutions and cropped to make the focus of the image visible at smaller sizes. In the code above, at larger than 750px, the browser fetches either horses-1600_large_2x.jpg (if the device has a 2x display) or horses-800_large_1x.jpg. If the window's width is less than 750px but greater than 500px, the browser fetches horses_medium.jpg. At less than 500px the browser fetches the fallback image, horses_small.jpg.

    Note: If the user's browser doesn't support the picture element, it fetches whatever is in the img element. The picture element is just used to specify multiple sources for the img element contained in it. The img element is what displays the image.
