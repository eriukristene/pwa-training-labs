Explanation
When a page loads, the tracking snippet script is executed.

At a high level, that analytics snippet gathers data from the user's IP address, user agent, and other page information, such as:

User's geographic location
User's browser and operating system (OS)
Screen size
If Flash or Java is installed
The referring site
This data is then sent as a pageview hit to your Google Analytics property (specified by your tracking ID).

The real-time section of the Google Analytics dashboard shows the hit received from this script execution, along with the page (Active Page) that it was executed on.

The code so far provides the minimum functionality of Google Analytics. From the data gathered by the analytics library, the pageview event allows Google Analytics to infer information such as:

The total time the user spends on the site
The time spent on each page and the order in which the pages are visited
Which internal links are clicked (based on the URL of the next pageview)
